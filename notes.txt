npm create-react-app ./
npm start

make sure to write 
	- import React from 'react' // bcoz is not originally written

- Create a components folder in src
	- .jsx & .css
	- folder name for compoonents should be small, first letter of component name should be capital, and for css file use small case

- We need to create import statement for all the componenets in App.js
	- To avoid mess, create a index.js file in components folder, and write export {default as Navbar} from './navbar/Navbar'

- NOw, import all of these components to App.js using import {Article, Navbar, .. } from './components';

- Now, we won't import all the components directly to app.js, 
	- We wil create containers folder, that are bigger components consisting of multiple componenets. 

- Now, create jsx and css file for all the containers, and create index.js inside container and export componenets

- set app.css file -> * {box-styling, margin, padding, 

- In index.js -> set the variable name and make them global by placing them inside :root
	- --font-family : 'Manrope'
	- --color-bg : #somecolor

- define gradients, --gradient-text

- generate css gradient code using angry tools
- generate animations using animista
- make responsive using ( @media and screen (max-width = 700px/550px ) {}

- Now import basic icons using react icons 

- use BEM -> block element modifier -> for naming classNames !!

- Now, start writing CSS in navbar.css
	- 70% of times use { display : flex , align-items : center, justify-items: center }
